# Real-time notifications – dependencies

Install this for real-time notification badge and live updates:

- **Frontend:** `socket.io-client`
  ```bash
  npm install socket.io-client
  ```

The backend must have `socket.io` installed and the server must attach the notification socket (see Backened).
